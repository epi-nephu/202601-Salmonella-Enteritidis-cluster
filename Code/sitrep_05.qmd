[A cluster of 6x confirmed Salmonella Enteritidis cgMLST 3303 cases has been detected in Victoria, with epidemiological links to a rooming house in Hawthorn (Carrical House) and a construction management company in Altona (Form 700).]{.red-text} 

[Case interviews have identified a potential food source for some of the cases (leftover food from a Christmas party at Form 700 donated to Carrical House). A routine inspection of the catering company who provided the food for the Christmas party identified no food safety or compliance issues. Two of the cases did not have a direct link to the Christmas party but either worked at Form 700 or in a similar industry. No cases detected outside of this. Leading hypothesis is cross contamination, likely from a returned traveller who handled food.]{.red-text} 

[No new cases have been reported since 22/01/2026. and the outbreak was declared closed on 06/02/2026.]{.red-text}

<div style="height: 0.1em;"></div>

- 4x confirmed cases identified by DH on 12/01/2026.
  - Whole genome sequencing confirmed all 4x isolates are closely related.
  - This cgMLST has not previously been detected in Victoria.
  - A fifth case associated with this cluster was identified on 21/01/2026.
  - A sixth case associated with this cluster was identified on 22/01/2026.

<div style="height: 0.1em;"></div>

- 4x confirmed cases reside in NEPHU catchment and 2x confirmed cases reside in WPHU catchment.

<div style="height: 0.1em;"></div>

- The most common symptoms are diarrhoea (12/13 cases, 92%), fever (5/13, 38%), vomiting (3/13, 23%), and abdominal pain (3/13, 23%).
  - Most cases are poor historians and unable to be contacted for interview, with information about symptoms, symptom onset, and symptom duration collected from proxies.
  
<div style="height: 0.1em;"></div>

- Potential source is donated food served at Carrical House, Hawthorn on the evening of 19/12/2025.
  - Donated food sourced from a Christmas party held at Form 700, Altona at lunchtime on [either 18/12/2025 or 19/12/2025.]{.red-text}
  - 3 out of [6]{.red-text} confirmed cases and [all 7]{.red-text} suspected cases consumed leftovers.
    - 1x confirmed case works at Form 700, but states that they did not attend the party held at Form 700 or consume any leftovers from the party. Case also stated that they did not recall eating any shared food or leftovers at Form 700.
    - 1x confirmed case has no known association with Carrical House or Form 700.
    - 1x [confirmed]{.red-text} case is an infant who resides with their parents in staff accommodation at Carrical House and does not consume solid foods. This case likely acquired their infection via secondary household transmission from their brother (Case 3) or father (Case 8).

- [Darebin Council conducted a routine inspection of the caterer for the Christmas party on 05/02/2026 with no issues identified.]{.red-text}

### Hypotheses on Source or Transmission

- [Four]{.red-text} out of [six]{.red-text} confirmed cases linked to Carrical House
  - 2x resident cases (Case 1 and Case 2), 1x child (Case 3) who lives on-site part-time, [1x child (Case 6) who lives on-site full-time]{.red-text}

<div style="height: 0.1em;"></div>

- [Three of the Carrical House associated cases]{.red-text} consumed food at a common dinner on 19/12/2025
  - Leftover food donated by a Carrical House staff member’s son’s (Case 7) work Christmas party at Form 700 on [either 18/12/2025 or 19/12/2025 (discrepancy in date of Christmas party from different sources)]{.red-text} was served at Carrical House on 19/12/2025
  - This was the only common meal shared by [these]{.red-text} confirmed cases
  - [The fourth confirmed Carrical House associated case is an infant who does not consume solid foods. They likely acquired their infection via secondary household transmission from a family member (Case 7 or Case 8).]{.red-text}
  - Likely temperature abuse of leftovers/donated food

<div style="height: 0.1em;"></div>

- Two confirmed cases (Case 4 and Case 5) do not have a known link to Carrical House
  - Case 5 works for Form 700 but did not attend the Christmas party on 18/12/2025 or consume leftovers from the party
  - Case 4 works in the construction industry (carpenter) but has no known link to Form 700

<div style="height: 0.1em;"></div>

- The donated food was a last-minute addition to the menu at Carrical House on 19/12/2025. The originally planned meal for that evening (frozen spaghetti bolognese) was also served
  - There have been no reports of illness from residents who only ate the spaghetti bolognese
  - Case 3 and Case 8 did not consume spaghetti bolognese or any other meals served at Carrical House

<div style="height: 0.1em;"></div>

- Donated food and spaghetti bolognese were served by Case 3, Case 8, and another staff member who has remained well
  - All food was served by staff members, no self-service of food
  - There were no reports of illness among staff at the time of serving food

<div style="height: 0.1em;"></div>

- [All seven]{.red-text} suspected cases consumed food sourced from the Form 700 Christmas party
  - Case 7 attended the Christmas party on 18/12/2025 and ate leftovers at home on 19/12/2025. He dropped food off to Carrical House but did not attend the common dinner at Carrical House on 19/12/2025
  - Cases 8, 9, and 10 attended the common dinner at Carrical House on 19/12/2025
